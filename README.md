🎮 How to Play
🎯 Objective
Manipulate the digital array to find and extract the target pattern before time runs out!
🎛️ Controls
➕ Insert Operation

Enter the index where you want to insert
Enter the value to insert (0-9)
Click "EXECUTE INSERT" or press Enter
Watch elements slide right with smooth animations

🗑️ Delete Operation

Enter the index of the element to delete
Click "EXECUTE DELETE" or press Enter
See elements slide left to fill the gap

🔍 Search Operation

Enter a pattern (e.g., "2,1,4")
Click "INITIATE SCAN" or press Enter
Watch the algorithm highlight each position as it searches
Celebrate when the pattern is found!

⚙️ System Controls

Reset Matrix: Restore array to initial state
New Mission: Start a fresh game with new target patterns

🏆 Victory Conditions

Level 1: Find any 2-digit pattern
Level 2: Find a 3-digit pattern
Level 3: Find a 3-digit pattern (Master level)
Complete all levels to become a Master Code Breaker!
